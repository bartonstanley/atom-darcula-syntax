# Sample Markdown with Atom Darcula

[Atom](https://atom.io/) is an Open Source text editor by GitHub "that's modern, approachable, yet hackable to the coreâ€”a tool you can customize to do anything but also use productively without ever touching a config file".

This repository contains a syntax theme for Atom inspired by [JetBrains](http://jetbrains.com) Darcula theme for IntelliJ, RubyMine and their other IDEs. It features more vivid colors than the original Darcula, but tries to keep as close as possible. This syntax theme is based on Atom's 'One Dark' theme and works best with the 'One Dark' UI theme.

## Installation

1. Open _Atom -> Settings -> Install_ and search for `atom-darcula-syntax theme`.
2. Click on the _Install_ button in the package card.
3. Open _Atom -> Settings -> Themes_ and select **Atom Darcula** from the _Syntax Theme_ selector dropdown.

## Some samples

### Let's add some code

```ruby
if some_code
  do_something
end
```

### And a quote!

> Dolore elit commodo velit consectetur deserunt deserunt amet nostrud excepteur in pariatur cupidatat dolor velit voluptate minim duis.

### And embedded code

<div class="whatever">
  <span>Whatever...</span>
</div>
